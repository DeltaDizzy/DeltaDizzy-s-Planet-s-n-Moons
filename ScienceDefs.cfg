	{
		default = #autoLOC_501258 //#autoLOC_501258 = You record the crew's assessment of the situation.

		IontopiaInSpaceLow = At this altitude, you notice that the "shadows" that you saw from higher up are actually just dark portion of the strangely smooth terrain.
		IontopiaInSpaceLow = Yo are alarmed to see your shadow on the surface, when you aren't even close to the surface yet!
		IontopiaInSpace = You notice that the edges of this planet appear to be Unnaturally smooth. You wonder how this came to be. Stange Geology must be at fault.
		IontopiaInSpace = While the edges look smooth, there are darker areas that appear to be the shadows of hills or mountains. "The view from them must be wonderful!", you think.
		IontopiaInSpace = You look down and see that, in several places, light-colored areas end in a sudden straight line, while others end gradually and more naturally.
