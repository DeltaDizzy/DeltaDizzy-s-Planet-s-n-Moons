	RESULTS
	{
		default = #autoLOC_501258 //#autoLOC_501258 = You record the crew's assessment of the situation.

		IontopiaInSpaceLow = At this altitude, you notice that the "shadows" that you saw from higher up are actually just dark portion of the strangely smooth terrain.

		IontopiaInSpace = You notice that the edges of this planet appear to be Unnaturally smooth. You wonder how this came to be. Stange Geology must be at fault.
		IontopiaInSpace = While the edges look smooth, there are darker areas that appear to be the shadows of hills or mountains. "The view from them must be wonderful!", you think.
		IontopiaInSpace = You look down and see that, in several places, light-colored areas end in a sudden straight line, while others end gradually and more naturally.

		EelooInSpace = #autoLOC_501300 //#autoLOC_501300 = The surface appears to be mostly frozen. You see some interesting brown areas peeking out of the ice and note them in your report.
		EelooInSpace = #autoLOC_501301 //#autoLOC_501301 = You search the sky for other nearby planets.  You think Eeloo must be lonely out here by itself. Maybe we should pay it a visit and cheer it up a bit.
